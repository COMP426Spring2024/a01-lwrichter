                <p>In Greek mythology, it is said that Prometheus stole fire from Heaven and gave it to mortals. This gift of power enraged the gods. In retaliation, Zeus instructed Hephaestus to create Pandora, who some believe to be the first woman. 
                    Zeus then presented Pandora to Epimetheus, Prometheus' brother, and they were married.<br><br>Pandora was given many gifts, including a jar (not actually a box) that she was told to keep close but never open. 
                    However, she did open the box, and its contents were released to the earth. There are disagreements about what was inside the jar, but it is most commonly believed that it contained many evils, including sickness, misery, and death.
                    Others believe the jar contained blessings that were lost upon its opening.</p>
                What do you think was in the jar?
